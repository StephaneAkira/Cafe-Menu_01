Cafe Menu Begin 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's time to add some menu content. 
Add a main element within the existing body element. 
It will eventually contain pricing information about 
coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.

To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, 
add a p element below the h1 element with the text Est. 2020.

That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. 
p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.

To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements so they behave more like inline elements.
To do that, start by adding a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading.

The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. 
You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named item like this:

Example Code
.item p { }

Using the above selector, 
add a display property with value inline-block so the p elements behave more like inline elements.

That's closer, but the price didn't stay over on the right. 
This is because inline-block elements only take up the width of their content. 
To spread them out, add a width property to the flavor and price class selectors that have a value of 50% each.

Well that did not work. Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines in the code 
creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, 
causing the second one to shift to the next line. White space characters can cause this issue as well.

One way to fix this is to make each p element's width a little less than 50%. Change the width value to 49% 
for each class to see what happens.

That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price.

You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, 
use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p element with the class price next to the p element with 
the class flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. 
Make sure there is no space between the two elements.

You will come back to styling the menu in a few steps, but for now, 
go ahead and add a second section element below the first for displaying the desserts offered by the cafe.

The typography of heading elements (e.g. h1, h2) is set by default values of users' browsers.

Add two new type selectors (h1 and h2). Use the font-size property for both, 
but use the value 40px for the h1 and 30px for the h2.

You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.
