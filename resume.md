# Notes and Structure of the Project:

HTML Boilerplate
have a div element (a container the main and footer element will be included here as well)

h1 with text : CAMPER CAFE
and a p element
then comes an hr element it's a void element it creates an Horizontal line

then we have the 1st section
with a h2 with text : Coffee
followed with a img element

then we have 5 article element with 2 nested p element inside it

then we have another section with a h2 element with text : Desserts
followed with an img element

then we have 5 article element with 2 nested p element inside it

the catch here is that we need the price to be on the right of the page and the flavors and desserts on the left of the page

we will need a float property on the .price and .flavors and .dessert

then we have an hr element

then the footer
that will include 2 p element , the first will be a nested p element inside the a
and the next P will just be a a normal p element
